## 🏹 What’s Dark and Darker?

It’s hardcore fantasy PvPvE: Think Dungeons & Dragons meets Tarkov. You dive into dark, dangerous dungeons with your squad (or solo), trying to score loot and survive the extraction.

But here’s the twist: Everyone else is trying to kill you for your gear.

No minimap. No mercy. And once you're dead? Say goodbye to everything.

## 🧠 What Does a Wallhack Do?

The **wallhack**, also known as ESP (Extrasensory Perception), lets you see the stuff the game *wants* you to miss. It doesn’t matter if you're behind a wall, in a dark corridor, or in total fog – everything lights up.

### Key Wallhack Features:

* 👥 **Player ESP** – See enemy players through walls with class tags and distance
* 💀 **Skeleton / Hitbox ESP** – Know exactly where to shoot or swing
* 💰 **Loot ESP** – Highlights treasure chests, rare drops, gear, keys, gold
* ☠️ **Trap & Mob ESP** – Spot ambushes before you step into them
* 🚪 **Exit & Portal ESP** – Always know where to escape
* 📏 **Distance Markers** – Know how far anything is before committing
* 🎯 **Name + Health Display** – Track player stats in real-time

Toggle visibility, set filter ranges, and customize colors for team vs enemies. Some builds even show hidden stashes and secret rooms.
